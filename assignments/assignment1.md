# Assignment 1: Foundational Skills

These assignments are designed to solidify your understanding of core programming concepts and build a practical foundation.

## 1. Programming Basics

- **`isPrime` Function**: Write a JavaScript function `isPrime(num)` that takes a number and returns `true` if it's a prime number, and `false` otherwise.
- **`Calculator` Class**: Implement a class `Calculator` with methods `add(a, b)`, `subtract(a, b)`, `multiply(a, b)`, and `divide(a, b)`. Write a test for each method.

## 2. Data Structures

- **Unique Mobile Numbers**: Create a `Set` of 10 random mobile numbers. Add a few duplicate numbers and then print the final size of the set to demonstrate its ability to store unique values.

## 3. Object-Oriented Design

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Build a small POM class for a fictional login page. The class should have a constructor and a `login` method that takes a username and password as arguments. Include a few sample locators as properties within the class.

## 4. Critical Thinking & Analysis

- **Language Comparison**: Write a short essay (200-300 words) or prepare a short presentation comparing the pros and cons of using JavaScript vs. Python vs. Java for automation in your current or a past professional context. Justify your preference.

# Usability Testing: Heuristic Review of Spotify Web

This document presents a heuristic review of the Spotify Web application, based on Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics.

## 1. Visibility of System Status

-   **Observation:** The system generally provides good feedback. For example, when a song is playing, the play/pause button changes, and the progress bar is clearly visible.
-   **Screenshot:** `images/visibility.png` (A screenshot showing the now playing bar with a song in progress).

## 2. Match Between System and the Real World

-   **Observation:** The application uses familiar icons and concepts. The play, pause, next, and previous buttons are universally understood. The concept of playlists and albums matches the real world.

## 3. User Control and Freedom

-   **Observation:** Users have good control. They can easily skip songs, go back, and adjust the volume. The "Undo" option for accidentally deleting a playlist is a good feature, but it's not immediately obvious.
-   **Improvement:** A more prominent "Undo" notification would be helpful.
-   **Screenshot:** `images/control.png` (A screenshot showing a playlist with the option to delete).

## 4. Consistency and Standards

-   **Observation:** The interface is mostly consistent. However, some icons and menus differ slightly between the web and desktop applications, which could confuse users who switch between them.
-   **Screenshot:** `images/consistency.png` (A comparison screenshot would be ideal here, but for this review, a shot of the web interface's library section is provided).

## 5. Error Prevention

-   **Observation:** The system does a good job of preventing errors. For example, it's not possible to add a duplicate song to a playlist.
-   **Screenshot:** `images/error-prevention.png` (A screenshot showing the "Add to playlist" dialog).

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

-   **Observation:** The "Recently Played" section is a great example of this heuristic. Users don't have to remember what they were listening to; the system shows them.
-   **Screenshot:** `images/recognition.png` (A screenshot of the "Recently Played" section on the home page).

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

-   **Observation:** The application is flexible. Users can search for music, browse curated playlists, or listen to their own library. Keyboard shortcuts are available for power users.
-   **Screenshot:** `images/flexibility.png` (A screenshot of the search results page).

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

-   **Observation:** The design is clean and modern. The focus is on the content (album art, song titles). There is very little clutter.
-   **Screenshot:** `images/design.png` (A screenshot of an album page).

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

-   **Observation:** Error messages are generally clear. For example, if the internet connection is lost, a clear message is displayed.
-   **Screenshot:** `images/error-recovery.png` (A screenshot of an offline notification).

## 10. Help and Documentation

-   **Observation:** The help section is comprehensive but can be difficult to navigate. A more intuitive search function within the help section would be beneficial.
